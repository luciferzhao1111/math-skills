# workspace_root = the directory the USER is working in (normally "$PWD"). The mp4/srt end up there.
#   Never pick another directory just because it already has .env / node_modules / pron.json.
# What it does:
# - copies template/ to <workspace_root>/<folder_name>/ (never node_modules / package*.json)
# - pron.py + pron.json: symlinks to the skill's shared copies (ONE lexicon for every video; a reading fixed
#   once is fixed everywhere). Existing files in the workspace are left alone.
# - node_modules: if the workspace has none, symlinks an existing install found above the skill (no 60 MB
#   re-install); otherwise writes package.json so you can `npm install` once.
